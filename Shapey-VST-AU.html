<p>Shapey! is an open source, experimental synthesiser with a unusal approach to wavetable synthesis. Its primary sound generator is a single "complex" wavetable oscillator with three sections. While it borrows terminology from FM synthesis, its architecture is quite different. The modulator controls the pitch and, to a certain extent, timing of a sample player (carrier), enabling several distinct synthesis techniques depending on their configuration.</p>

<p>An additional collection of sounds and presets is available for purchase here. Not only does this expand Shapey!'s sonic capabilities, but it also helps support its future developmentâ€”and me, the person who made it.</p>

<h2>Modulator</h2>

<p>In its first mode, the modulator functions as a simple multi-waveform oscillator with pitch, glide, and output gain controls. A sub-oscillator with phase and AM controls can be added to the signal. Additionally, the pitch can be quantized or synced to tempo, allowing it to act as an LFO. In its second mode, it replicates the entire oscillator section, placing a sample player after the oscillator, which enables the use of two samples within a single patch.</p>

<h2>Transformer</h2>

<p>The transformer sits between the modulator and carrier, providing various waveshaping, FX, and filtering options. It includes a mix control along with two additional controls whose functionality depends on the current mode.</p>

<h2>Carrier</h2>

<p>The carrier is a versatile sample player with controls for position, input gain, smoothing, quantization, and pitch shifting.</p>

<h2>The Filter and "VCA"</h2>

<p>The filter is a dual low-pass/high-pass design, similar to the Korg MS-20, capable of operating in serial or parallel. Additionally, the "modulator in" control allows the signal from the modulator to be routed directly into the filter, finally there is a simple AHDSR envelope at the end of the chain.</p>

<h2>The Modulators</h2>

<p>The modulation section includes an AHDSR envelope, a looping AR envelope with tempo-synced attack and release stages, a loopable table envelope, and two master LFOs with multiple wave shapes and quantization options.</p>

<h2>The Arpeggiator</h2>

<p>A flexible arpeggiator/step sequencer rounds out the feature set.</p>

<p>Built with HISE & FAUST.</p>
